## Hi there 👋

### I'm a Software Engineering Leader & Developer

Software professional since 2017, evolved into engineering leadership in high-growth startups since 2021. Specialising in distributed systems, local-first collaborative applications, and high-performance frontend architectures.

🛠️ Leadership & Impact

- 💡 Built and scaled engineering teams from prototype to production
- 🎯 Established engineering practices across distributed teams
- 💻 Balanced innovation with reliable delivery in fast-paced environments
- 🔄 Cultivated lean, pragmatic development workflows that prioritise shipping over ceremony

💡 Technical Interests
- 🦀 Comfortable in TypeScript and Clojure, attempting to learn Rust.
- 🔄 Special interest in collaborative, local-first applications
- 📱 Perpetually tinkering with probably useless side projects, I just like building things

🏃‍♂️ Beyond the Keyboard
- 🏊‍♂️ Completed multiple endurance events including an Ironman triathlon, marathons, and bike races
- 🏓 Competitive table tennis player
- 🎵 Play several instruments, but none of them particularly well
- 🗣️ Conversationalish in Japanese (話すの読むのちょっとできるけど書くのムリ～)
